# SQL-project
The aims of this project is to analyse the data of Food prices, availability to to public, Salaries and Economy between 2000 - 2021.

As part of the project, I tried to answer several pre-defined research questions:

1. Are wages rising in all industries over the years or falling in some?
2. How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wages data?
3. Which food category price is increasing the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?
4. Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (higher than 10%)?
5. Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?
